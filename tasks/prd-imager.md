# Imager – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction / Overview
Imager is a web-based image editor that aggregates a curated collection of high-quality, creative visual effects into a single, fast, and beautifully designed tool. It solves the problem of creative effects being scattered across multiple apps by allowing users to upload an image, apply one-click artistic effects (including animated effects), layer multiple effects, and export the final asset in its original resolution as a static image or an animated GIF/MP4/WebM. The experience is designed to be instant, fun, and mobile-friendly, enabling rapid creative expression without the complexity of traditional tools like Photoshop.

## 2. Goals
1. Provide an intuitive interface that lets users apply and preview effects in < **300 ms**.
2. Allow users to stack unlimited effects and see the combined result in real time.
3. Support export of edited images at their original resolution without quality loss.
4. Enable export of animated effects as high-quality GIFs, MP4, and WebM videos.
5. Maintain < **2 s** initial load time on desktop and mobile networks.
6. Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) ≥ **60** among target users.
7. Provide professional-grade photo editing capabilities while maintaining simplicity.
