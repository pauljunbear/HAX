## Current Status: Phase 4 - UX Optimization

**Completed:** Apple-style layout foundation, effects browser, and controls panel
**In Progress:** Addressing user feedback on export confusion, collapsibility, and button hierarchy
**Next:** Performance optimization and advanced workflow features

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Dual Sidebar Approach** - Separates browsing (left) from editing (right) for clear mental model
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Collapsible panels maximize canvas space when needed
3. **Contextual Actions** - Export and settings appear only when relevant
4. **Visual Hierarchy** - Clear primary/secondary button distinction
5. **Rapid Iteration** - One-click effect application with instant preview
